Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
    -->I created a default contructor for all of the subclasses because it would make sense to have a default constructor incase someone did not have the parameters to create the buildings. 
    -->For the Cafe subclass, I made an overloaded constructor that allows you to add the stock in the inventory manually. 
    -->For the Library class and house class I created an overloaded method for gotToFloor, goUp and goDown. I did this so that the user could navigate through non-adjacent floors if the building had an elevator. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
-->I was slightly confused on phase 2 and 1 and how I would have the goToFloors method both return invalid if called and using it to navigate through mulitple floors if there is an elevator. So I just overloaded the method so I could have it do both. I would recommend for someone to write out the steps in the readme.md and map out what they want to do with their program.
